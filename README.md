# Data::Fetch

Give advance warning that you'll be needing a value

# VERSION

Version 0.03

# SYNOPSIS

Sometimes we know in advance that we'll be needing a value which is going to take a long time to compute or determine.
This module fetches the value in the background so that you don't need to wait so long when you need the value.

    use CalculatePi;
    use Data::Fetch;
    my $fetcher = Data::Fetch->new();
    my $pi = CalculatePi->new(places => 1000000);
    $fetcher->prime(object => $pi, message => 'as_string');     # Warn we'll run $pi->as_string() in the future
    # Do other things
    print $fetcher->get(object => $pi, message => 'as_string'), "\n";   # Runs $pi->as_string()

# SUBROUTINES/METHODS

## new

Creates a Data::Fetch object.  Takes no argument.

## prime

Say what is is you'll be needing later.
Takes two mandatory parameters:

    object - the object you'll be sending the message to
    message - the message you'll be sending

Takes one optional parameter:
    arg - passes this argument to the message

## get

Retrieve get a value you've primed.  Takes two mandatory parameters:

    object - the object you'll be sending the message to
    message - the message you'll be sending

Takes one optional parameter:
    arg - passes this argument to the message

# BUGS

Can't pass more than one argument to the message.

I would not advise using this to call messages that change values in the object.

Changing a value between prime and get will not necessarily get you the data you want. That's the way it works
and isn't going to change.

If you change a value between two calls of get(), the earlier value is always used.  This is definitely a feature
not a bug.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to `bug-data-fetch at rt.cpan.org`,
or through the web interface at
[http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Data-Fetch](http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Data-Fetch).
I will be notified, and then you'll
automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.
